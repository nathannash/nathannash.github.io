	<h3>
		Summary
	</h3>
	<p>
		BuckStars App is an iOS App that helps Starbucks customers pre-purchase their coffee. It solves this problem by allowing customers to pay from their phone and fulfill their order at a Starbucks of their choice. My role was a UX designer and this project was self-started.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Discovery
	</h3>
	<p>
		I examined check-out systems Taco Bell, Domino’s and OLO  in order to find opportunities for innovation. The analysis gave me the momentum I needed to come up with the design goals. For this app to be successful these features were crucial: menu, ordering, checkout, payment processing, in store fulfillment and order processing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the features had been defined, I created the persona. This persona served as the template for the user journey and storyboard. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		After I gained an understanding of the user’s needs, I could move forward to the design process.

		Design
	</h3>	
	<p>
		At a high level, I created a sitemap, this allowed me to identify user flows for later use in testing. It also helped me understand the unique interactions between each screen. Next, I designed the wireframes in Sketch. These wireframes helped keep the UI design on task. By having 20% of the work done, all that was left is to “add a splash of color”.
	</p>	 
	<p>
		For the UI design I went with a modern and dark aesthetic. It matches StarBucks own branding; however the financial tracking screen deviates a bit.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Finally, with the bulk of the discovery and design phase done I moved on to the prototype. Using MarvelApp (a tool similar to InVision) I put together the screens so that I could test two key flows. The ordering system, and the finance tracking.

	<h3>
		Insights
	</h3>
	<p>
		User research allows you to make informed design decisions. When working alone it is easy to second guess your own aesthetic. Relying on a second set of eyes is crucial.
	</p>	
	<p>
		Most surprising, was when a tech-savvy but non-designer tester made a great comment about the fonts. Originally they were too sharp and caused him some eye strain. I switched to a humanist font with softer edges.
	</p>
	<p>
		Drafting a storyboard was perhaps the most unique challenge. This isn’t something I do a lot of but it was a fun deliverable to create. My favorite part of the design process was building the prototype. It’s incredibly rewarding to see your designs come to life.
