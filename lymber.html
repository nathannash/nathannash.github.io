	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		GetLymber.com is a landing page promotes the Lymber fitness service and advertises their iOS app. It accomplishes this by showcasing the partnership program, locations and mission statement as well as providing a link to the iTunes App Store.
	</p>
	<h3>Discovery</h3>
	<p>
		I did a competitive audit in order to create a fresh and unique designs. Primarily focusing on the landing page, partner page and signup form.
	</p>
	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>
		I created wireframes and a sitemap in Sketch to show the site’s hierarchy and iterate on designs based on client feedback. These wireframes were then handed off to our developer with light annotations.
