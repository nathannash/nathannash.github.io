					I have a passion for design that comes from a need to create user-centered products which bridge the design gap between customers and management. It’s my goal to help your software development team iterate quickly toward your deadline. Develop your product faster, validate hypotheses, and reach a product market fit through iterative testing. My obsessive attention to detail and knowledge of creating UX for complex end-to-end systems ensures that your solutions will be elegant and minimalist.

					During past professional experience I have worked with international finance, healthcare and local fortune 500 companies to design world class user experiences. Past clients include Mirum, HSBC, ManuLife Hong Kong, Lymber Fitness, Toyota and the Jr. NBA.

					In addition to vast range of work experience, I am well travelled, having been to a dozen countries and U.S. states. In addition to travel my interests include: fitness, cooking, history, music, tv/film and offbeat news. With my combined skills and background I’m confident that I’ll not only be a good resource, but a great culture fit for your organization. My friends would describe me as honest, diligent, kind and intelligent and past employers are fond of my work ethic.

				<p>
					My passion for design lies in the opportunities to use it as a force for social good. I believe that design is a tool which can empower organizations and individuals to make positive changes no matter how small. If you value a clean, minimal and elegant aesthetic a hard worker and a team player you’re in good company with me.
