					As a designer my expertise lies in creating engaging, user-centered interfaces which are strategically aligned to the wants and needs of the customer. Ultimately it is my goal to create interfaces which will engage your customers in such a way that they enter the magic circle and are so immersed in the product that they experience a suspension of disbelief.

					In my career as a User Experience Designer I have worked on brands such as Jr. NBA, ManuLife Financial, The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Toshiba and American Public University.

					My design process spans the design pipeline from end-to-end. Starting with research processes that allow me to understand the competitive landscape, define the product and connect with the user on a deeper level through the development of personas. Once the scope of the project has been defined I like to work on the document specifications in wireframing software such as Axure which I also use to create interactive HTML prototypes for usability testing. Finally after iterating on the prototype based on insights generated from user testing I begin applying the visual design in order to create a unique look and feel.

					Personally, I do not believe in the age old adage “the user is stupid”, to me this phrase represents a mismatch in expectations between the mental models of the designer/developer against the user who may not understand computers/software from our perspectives. In my view, it is important to include the user in the design process as early on as possible in order to better understand and more efficiently serve their needs.

					I believe that my unique background combined with my previous work and education experiences will allow me to easily fit into your company. I look forward to having the opportunity to meet with you to discuss your next project.
