				<p  >As a designer my expertise lies in creating engaging, user-centered interfaces which are strategically aligned to the wants and needs of the customer. Ultimately it is my goal to create interfaces which will engage your customers in such a way that they enter the magic circle and are so immersed in the product that they experience a suspension of disbelief.</p>

				<p  >My design process spans the design pipeline from end-to-end. I generally start with research practices such as competitive analysis and follow up with either a value proposition or an empathy map. These methodologies allow me to understand the competitive landscape, define the product and connect with the user on a deeper level through the development of personas. Once the scope of the project has been defined I like to work on the document specifications in wireframing software such as Axure which I also use to create interactive HTML prototypes for usability testing. Finally after iterating on the prototype based on insights generated from user testing I begin applying the visual design in order to create a unique look and feel.</p> 

				<p  >Personally, I do not believe in the age old adage “the user is stupid”, to me this phrase represents a mismatch in expectations between the mental models of the designer/developer against the user who may not understand computers/software from our perspectives. In my view, it is important to include the user in the design process as early on as possible in order to better understand and more efficiently serve their needs.</p>

				<p  >I look forward to having the opportunity to meet with you to discuss your next project.</p>
