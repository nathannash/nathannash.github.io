		Background
	</h3>
	<p>
		As a contractor I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities. One day while browsing job openings I saw a post for Chef UX. A Seattle based company that sounded like a cool place to work. After applying I recieved a communique from the hiring manager asking me to do some spec work for a hypothetical project. I obliged and began working on it right away.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Scenario
	</h3>
	<p>
		The design brief went like this: Our story centers around a woman named Julia, she is a young urban professional who is married with two kids. Like many of us she needs her coffee in the morning, and just can't live without it! My goal was to design an app that would allow her to get her coffee regardless of any interruptions to her morning routine.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Process
	</h3>	
	<p>
		At this point I would like to invite you to view the design process that went into bringing the BuckStars concept to life. Please view the presentation below:
