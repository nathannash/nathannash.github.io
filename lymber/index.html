	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Last Spring, my friends over at Folklore Digital reached out to me for some help on a client project. They needed a UX Designer who could handle some of their IA needs on a new client site and I was at the top of their short list. After getting the formalities of business out of the way I headd over to their Uptown office to get started.</p>
	<h3>Lymber Fitness</h3>
	<p>The gym without the commitment, Lymber's goal is to get people working out, to improve the physical health and disease resistance of its members. By working with partnered gyms Lymber is able to create a dynamically priced listing of classes designed to get people moving.</p>
	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>My goal for this project was to create the information architecture for <a href="http://getlymber.com">getlymber.com</a>, showcase their partners and their mobile app.</p>
